=>Titanic Survival Analysis (Jupyter Notebook Project)
This is a simple and fun data analysis project I did using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. I used Jupyter Notebook and Python to explore the data, clean it up, and look for interesting patterns — like who had a better chance of surviving the Titanic disaster and why.

-> What This Project Is About
Using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle , I tried to answer questions like:
* Did women have a higher survival rate?
* Did first-class passengers fare better than others?
* Did your age or where you boarded the ship affect your chances?

To answer these, I did some basic data cleaning and created easy-to-read bar charts.
-> Tools I Used
* Jupyter Notebook – for step-by-step analysis
* pandas – to clean and manage the data
* seaborn & matplotlib – for creating visualizations

->How to Run This Notebook
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
2. Your browser will open — click on `Titanic.ipynb`.
3. Run each cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
That’s it! You’ll see the data analysis and charts right there in the notebook.

This project was a great way to practice working with real data — cleaning it, analyzing it, and visualizing it.
Thanks for checking out my project! 😊
